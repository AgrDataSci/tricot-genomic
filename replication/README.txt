We evaluated a panel of fully genotyped 400 wheat lines derived from genebank accessions in two managed fields in the Ethiopian highlands in 2012 and 2013. We collected phenotypic data and farmer evaluation data in this trial. For the decentralized trial, we distributed a subset of 41 genotypes as packaged sets containing incomplete blocks of three genotypes, plus one commercial variety for each farmer, following the “tricot” citizen science approach. We distributed these packages to 1,165 farmers who planted them on their farms across three regions of Ethiopia. Analyzing data from the centralized and decentralized trials in a side-by-side comparison, we evaluated if our approach can increase genetic gain in marginal crop production environments unlocking the full potential of genomics assisted breeding.

The file "durumwheat.xlsx" contain the trails data related to decentralized stations (farmers' plots). Full description of the data is available in its first spreadsheet.

The file "diversity.panel.data.gp.rda" contain the agronomic and farmer evaluation data in the centralized stations. Centralized trials were performed in 2012 and 2013 in the districts of Geregera (Amhara) and Hagreselam (Tigray). The trial was laid out in a replicated alpha lattice design, and field managements were conducted as per local guidelines with manual weeding. Research technicians measured grain yield (GY) as grams of grain produced per plot, then converted into t/ha. In 2012, thirty experienced smallholder farmers growing durum wheat (15 men and 15 women) were invited to participate in the trial evaluations at the station plots, held concurrently after flowering stage. The farmers had no previous knowledge of the varieties included in this study to prevent bias in the evaluations. The participants provided appraisal with Likert scales (1 to 5 worse to best) given to genotypes for overall appreciation (OA).

The file "genotypic.data.durum.wheat.rda" contain the SNPs positions of genotypes. Genotypes were selected from a representative collection of accessions from the Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute. Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh leaves pooled from five seedlings for each of the accessions with the GenEluteTM Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma‐Aldrich, St Louis, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions in the Molecular and Biotechnology Laboratory at Mekelle University, Ethiopia. Genomic DNA was checked for quantity and quality by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and NanodropTM 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA). Genotyping was performed on the Infinium 90k wheat chip at TraitGenetics GmbH (Gatersleben, Germany). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called using the tetraploid wheat pipeline in GenomeStudio V11 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). SNP calls were cleaned for quality by filtering positions and samples with failure rate above 80% and heterozygosity above 50%. Full details on the genotyping are given by Mengistu et al. (2016) (http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/pbi.12538).

The "script/" folder contain the main R scripts used to analyse the data. A session info file (as .txt) is provided for each script to ensure backward compatibility if needed.
