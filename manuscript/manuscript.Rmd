# Introduction 
- wheat is the second largest ceral grain cultivated worldwide
- most of durum wheat's genetic diversity is found in Ethiopia 
- even though most farmers are exposed to a small set of Mediterranean modern varieties
-

# Part 2

Farmer evaluation traits can predict metric traits fairly well, depending on their derivation.  Overall, spike, and GY observed in first year have a similar performance in predicting GY in the second year (Fig. 2A). Farmers scores (both overall and spike) well predict TGW in 2013. There is a gender interaction, especially in overall, as arguably men and women have a different interpretation of the overall appreciation of varieties. When men and women criteria are contrasting, the prediction power decreases (see overall, overall.f and overall.m over GY in 2013). When they are aligned, the prediction power increases (see overall, overall.f and overall.m over DF in 2013; farmers are very worried about late maturation of varieties).
