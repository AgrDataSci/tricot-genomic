# Data-driven decentralized breeding increases genetic gain in challenging crop production environments 

Crop breeding must embrace the broad diversity of smallholder agricultural systems to ensure food security to the hundreds of million people living on challenging production environments. This challenge can be addressed by combining genomics, farmers’ knowledge, and environmental analysis into a data-driven decentralized design called 3D-breeding. We tested this approach with durum wheat (*Triticum durum* Desf.) in 1,165 farmer plots distributed across the Ethiopian highlands. We found that 3D-breeding could double the accuracy of the benchmark of genomic selection applied to conventional breeding. 3D-breeding could identify genotypes with enhanced local adaptation providing estimated consistent yield advantages across seasons and locations. If broadly adopted, 3D-breeding may leverage the diversity of farmer fields to change the paradigm of plant breeding for local adaptation in a changing climate.
