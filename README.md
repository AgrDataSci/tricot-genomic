# Data-driven decentralized breeding increases genetic gain in challenging crop production environments 

Plant breeding approaches must embrace the broad diversity of smallholder agricultural systems to ensure food security to millions living in challenging crop production environments. This challenge can be addressed by combining genomic selection, farmers’ traditional knowledge and environmental analysis into a data-driven decentralized design called 3D-breeding. We tested this hypothesis with durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) in 1,165 farmer plots scattered across the Ethiopian highlands. By combining these three dimensions, we show that 3D-breeding can double the accuracy of genomic selection and variety recommendations to multiple environments, providing consistent yield advantages in marginal areas where centralized breeding approaches would fail. If broadly adopted, 3D-breeding may leverage the diversity of farmer fields to change the paradigm of plant breeding for local adaptation in a changing climate.
